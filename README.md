# YouTube Community Bot

A Discord Bot that posts updates when a new YouTube Community Post is posted from a YouTube Channel.

Subscribers are not always notified of every community post from a subscribed channel so this Discord Bot aims to solve this by creating a new post in a specified server channel whenever a channel releases a new Community Post.
